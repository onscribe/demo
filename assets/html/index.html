<p>This is a demo of a client app that uses the <a href="https://github.com/onscribe/embed">Onscribe Embed script</a> for granting access to content.</p>

<p>It is also a donation program for the service, allowing everyone that believes in Onscribe to show their support in a meaningful way. All proceedings go towards supporting the continued development of <a href="http://onscri.be/">Onscribe</a>.</p>

<p>Onscribe is created by a small startup in San Francisco called <a href="http://kdi.co/">K&amp;D Interactive</a>. A collective of experienced developers, quite independent, with humble beginnings and proud to be fighting against the current to provide services that serve the people.</p>

<p>We believe in an open Web where users get to choose their payment gateway independently from consuming online content and that there are no restrictions set for accessing the content across platforms.</p>

<div>
	<p>For $1 per month you get:</p>
